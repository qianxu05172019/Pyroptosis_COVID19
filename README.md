# Bioinformatics Analysis of scRNA-seq Data

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a comprehensive workflow for analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. It encompasses data preprocessing, visualization, and advanced analysis techniques to understand cell type distributions, differential gene expression, and condition-specific responses.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following R packages for data analysis:

- **Seurat**: For preprocessing and analysis of scRNA-seq data.
- **ggplot2**: For advanced graphical representations.
- **dplyr**: For data manipulation.
- **patchwork**: For arranging plots.
- **harmony**: For integrating datasets from different conditions.
- **fgsea**: For gene set enrichment analysis.
- **Nebulosa**: For visualization of gene expression density.

## Repository Structure

- `scripts/`: Contains all R scripts used for data analysis.
  - `prep_data.r`: Scripts for data preparation and normalization.
  - `analysis.r`: Scripts for conducting various analyses, including clustering and differential expression.
  - `visualizations.r`: Scripts for generating plots and figures to visualize findings.
- `data/`: Directory for raw and processed data files.
- `results/`: Output directory for analysis results and figures.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis:
1. Install all required R packages.
2. Run the scripts in the `scripts/` directory in order.
3. Check the `results/` directory for output and figures.
